    <h2>Hello, my name is Ofuchi and I am sick of the internet.</h2>
    <h3>Why a website?</h3>
    <!--align to the left-->
    <p>
      Sometimes, quite literally. I find myself getting screensick very often. I
      had a bad routine of waking up, rolling over, and opening LinkedIn. I
      ignored all the texts my friend sent, ignored my body's cry for movement,
      ignored the fact my day started at 3pm and my stomach was empty. I fell
      into the habbit of doing the exact opposite of what every mindfulness book
      would've told you to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I would reach for my phone, I found myself on Instagram comparing my
      life with that of others, blah blah blah, all the sterotypical things
      people say about the internet. I found myself one day wishing I were a
      teen during the early 2000s, a feeling especially accentuated after
      watching Sean Wang's <b>Didi</b>. After listening to a couple podcast
      interviews with Wang and scrolling the Didi Instagram account, I
      remembered that I had a degree in Computer Science and the ability to
      build my own corner of the internet. So hello :)
    </p>

    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
    <p>
      Phonetically said <i>oh-foo-chee</i>, I am a creator and creative who
      loves baking, writing, gardening, and listening to indie music.
