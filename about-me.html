          This is a bit about me! I found myself getting screensick very often. I
          had a bad routine of waking up, rolling over, and opening LinkedIn. I
          ignored all the texts my friend sent, ignored my body's cry for movement,
          ignored the fact my day started at 3pm and my stomach was empty. I fell
          into the habbit of doing the exact opposite of what every mindfulness book
          would've told you to do. <br/> When I would reach for my phone, I found myself on Instagram comparing my
          life with that of others, blah blah blah, all the sterotypical things
          people say about the internet. I found myself one day wishing I were a
          teen during the early 2000s, a feeling especially accentuated after
          watching Sean Wang's <b>Dìdi</b>. After listening to a couple podcast
          interviews with Wang and scrolling the Dìdi Instagram account, I
          remembered that I had a degree in Computer Science and the ability to
          build my own corner of the internet. So hello! :)

    <h2>Hello, my name is Ofuchi and I am sick of the internet.</h2>
    <h3>Why a website?</h3>

      Quite literally. I found myself getting screensick very often. I
      had a bad routine of waking up, rolling over, and opening LinkedIn. I
      ignored all the texts my friend sent, ignored my body's cry for movement,
      ignored the fact my day started at 3pm and my stomach was empty. I fell
      into the habbit of doing the exact opposite of what every mindfulness book
      would've told you to do.
